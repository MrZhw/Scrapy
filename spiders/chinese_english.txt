巴拉就招聚西布伦人和拿弗他利人, 跟他上他泊山去的有一万人。在山下的基顺河边, 西西拉也聚集了所有的九百辆铁车, 和他的全部军队。以色列人和西西拉的军队比起来, 真是众寡悬殊, 他们怎么可能赢呢？但是, 别忘了, 神的大能与以色列人同在。底波拉坚信神会帮助他们。她鼓励巴拉说："你起来, 今日就是耶和华将西西拉交在你手的日子, 耶和华岂不在你前头行么？" 底波拉在众人面前显现出她单单倚靠神的信心。

Barak gathered his army of 10, 000 and they went to Mount Tabor. Sure enough, down below the mount, by the Kishon River, General Sisera was gathering his huge army with their 900 iron chariots. It does not look like a fair battle, it does not look like Israel could possibly win. But the mighty power of God was there, though invisible to the human eye. Deborah knew God was there! She spoke bold, encouraging words to Barak："Up, for this is the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand! Hasn't the Lord already gone out before you?" What a great example of faith and purity Deborah was!

如果你是神的孩子, 神也希望你在人面前成为信心的榜样。记住我们今天的圣经经节, 还有我们在前几课里常常提到的四点：想, 说, 祷告, 顺服。想想看, 我所作的能够让我成为众人的榜样吗？说出提摩太前书4章12节来提醒自己。然后祷告求神来给你能力。最后, 要顺服神的带领。当你看见别的基督徒作错事的时候, 你不但要坚持对的, 还要用圣经经节来鼓励他们。最近我听到一个故事。有一个父亲在主日没有敬拜神, 他的小儿子就用圣经里的话来提醒他。他就听了儿子的劝告。虽然你可能年纪不大, 但你仍然可以鼓励别人来作敬畏神的事, 这样, 你就成为众人的榜样。

If you are a child of God, He wants you to be an example of faith and purity to other believers. Remember our Bible verse today from I Timothy 4：12, and remember our four power words we've been learning through the previous lessons：Think：Am I being a godly example by what I'm doing'say：I Timothy 4：12 Pray：for God to give you power to do what's right so you are an example that others can follow. Obey by doing what's right! Do you see other believers who are being tempted to do wrong?Encourage them by not only doing the right thing, but tell them a Bible verse that will help. I recently heard about a father whose young son reminded him of the Bible verse to keep the Lord's Day holy. That father was so encouraged to do the right thing, just because of what his young son said. Even though you are young, you can be a good example by encouraging others to do the right thing.

底波拉鼓励巴拉下了他泊山, 按照神的吩咐去迎敌。底波拉的信心鼓舞了以色列人, 他们冲下山去。正象底波拉所说的, 神实在是在他们的前面为他们开路。神让地上变得泥泞, 使西西拉的铁车没法开动, 他的士兵只好跳下车逃跑。神使西西拉和他一切车辆全军溃乱, 他们被巴拉的军队杀败。连西西拉也下车步行逃跑。他跑到一个他认为安全的地方, 就是希百的妻子雅亿的帐棚, 他知道耶宾王与希百有和约, 他的妻子一定会帮他, 把他藏起来。雅亿出来迎接西西拉, 让他不要怕。西西拉就进了她的帐棚, 雅亿给他牛奶喝, 还用被子将他遮盖住。西西拉跑累了, 很快就进入了梦香。圣经说, 雅亿拿了支帐棚的橛子, 从他鬓边钉进去, 西西拉就死了。

Deborah was encouraging Barak to go on down and fight as the Lord had commanded!Barak and his army charged down that mountain, cheered on by Deborah's words of faith. And God had gone before them, just as Deborah said! In fact, God sent a thunderstorm that turned the ground under Sisera's chariots into sticky mud. What do you think happened to those iron chariot wheels?Because the chariot wheels got stuck, Sisera's soldiers jumped out of the chariots and ran, but not fast enough. God was helping Barak's soldiers to defeat this mighty army! Even Sisera jumped from his chariot and ran. He ran to what he thought would be a safe hiding place. After all, he knew that Heber was at peace with King Jabin, so surely Heber's wife Jael would hide him in her tent. Sure enough, Jael welcomed the very frightened, very tired General Sisera into her tent. She gave him milk to drink and covered him. Sisera was so tired from running, that he quickly fell sound asleep, " and never woke up. The Bible tells us that Jael took a tent peg and hammered it through Sisera's head, killing him.

当巴拉追上来的时候, 雅亿出来迎接他说："来吧, 我将你所寻找的人给你看。" 你还记得神通过底波拉所说的话吗：耶和华要将西西拉交在一个妇人手里。现在, 这句话果然应验了。因著神的大能, 巴拉打败了迦南王耶宾的军队。

When Barak came by, Jael stopped him."Come, and I will show you the man you are looking for." Do you remember what God had spoken through Deborah?" God will give Sisera into the hand of a woman." Through God's power, Barak and his army defeated King Jabin's army that day. Israel grew stronger and stronger until finally King Jabin was completely destroyed.

打完了仗, 底波拉和巴拉带领以色列人唱歌感谢。他们大声歌唱, 感谢赐给他们胜利。士师记五章31节这样结尾："这样国中太平四十年。"

When the battle was over, Deborah and Barak led the people of Israel in songs of praise to God. They had cried out to God, and He had given them great victory! Judges 5：31 ends by saying, "And the land had rest forty years."

如果底波拉没有在人面前成为一个敬虔的榜样, 你觉得神会使用她来帮助以色列人吗？不会的！因为她所说的话以色列人是不会听的。如果你已经接受主耶稣成为你的救主, 那么你愿不愿意像底波拉一样在人面前成为一个敬虔的榜样。你要注意你的话语, 行为, 态度, 要在爱心, 信心, 清洁上, 都作信徒的榜样。记住我们前面提到的四点：想想看, 我所作所说的, 能够让我成为众人的榜样吗？说出提摩太前书4章12节来提醒自己。然后祷告求神来给你能力坚持对的事。最后, 要顺服神的带领。

If Deborah had not been a godly example, do you think God could have used her to be such a great help to her people?No, because they probably would not have respected her enough to believe and follow her counsel. If you know the Lord Jesus as your Savior from sin, will you this week be a godly example?Be watchful in your words, actions, love, attitudes, as well as in your faith and pure life. Remembering your four power words will help! Think, say, pray, obey! Think：Am I being a good example in what I am saying and doing right now'say：I Timothy 4：12. Pray：Asking God to show you and help you do what's right. Obey：Then do the right thing! When you are doing right, you are being a good example!

如果你还没有接受耶稣做你的救主, 你就不能为大家做榜样, 做表率。但耶稣愿意你来认识他, 只有他才能把你从罪中拯救出来。要想认识耶稣, 你现在就可以去听"怎样成为神的孩子"，并照着那里所说的去做。
